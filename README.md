Terraform Execution Steps

Before executing the Terraform scripts, ensure you have set up a service account in Google Cloud with owner access and configured your Terraform environment appropriately. Then, execute the following commands in your terminal:

    Terraform Initialization:

    terraform init


terraform init

This command initializes the Terraform environment, preparing it to execute your infrastructure scripts.

Terraform Planning:

terraform plan


The plan command displays the actions Terraform will perform based on the scripts you've written. This step is crucial for reviewing changes before they are applied.

Terraform Apply:


    terraform apply

    Finally, apply your Terraform configuration to create the resources in GCP. This command will prompt you to confirm the actions before proceeding.

Ensure you review the changes listed by terraform plan before confirming the terraform apply execution.
